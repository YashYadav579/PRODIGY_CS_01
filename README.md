# 🔐 PRODIGY_CS_01 - Caesar Cipher (GUI Version)

### ✅ Internship Task - Prodigy Infotech (Cyber Security Track)

This repository contains **Task 01** of the **Prodigy Infotech Cyber Security Internship**, where I implemented a **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption tool using **Python** and **Tkinter**. This tool provides an intuitive graphical user interface for secure message encoding and decoding based on user-defined shift values.

## 💡 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest known encryption techniques. It’s a **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions forward or backward in the alphabet.  
Example:  
If the shift is `3`, then `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, and so on.

## 🎯 Features of This Project

- 🔤 **Encrypt & Decrypt** text using Caesar Cipher
- 📥 **User-friendly GUI** built with `Tkinter`
- 🔢 Accepts custom **shift values**
- 🧠 Smart validation for inputs
- 📋 Copy the result to the **clipboard**
- 🚫 Handles non-alphabet characters without affecting them

## 🛠️ How to Run

> ⚠️ Python must be installed on your system (version 3.x)

### 👉 Steps:

1. **Download** or **clone** this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YashYadav579/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
```
2. **Navigate to the folder:**

3. **Run the application:**
```bash
python caesar_cipher_gui.py
```
> 💡 The GUI will open where you can input your message, shift value, and choose to encrypt or decrypt.
