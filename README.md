# 🔐 PRODIGY_CS_01 - Caesar Cipher (GUI Version)

### ✅ Internship Task - Prodigy Infotech (Cyber Security Track)

This repository contains **Task 01** of the **Prodigy Infotech Cyber Security Internship**, where I implemented a **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption tool using **Python** and **Tkinter**. This tool provides an intuitive graphical user interface for secure message encoding and decoding based on user-defined shift values.

## 💡 What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest known encryption techniques. It’s a **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions forward or backward in the alphabet.  
Example:  
If the shift is `3`, then `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, and so on.
